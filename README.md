3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    The project uses an AI model to generate quotes. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your API key.
    ```env
    # Example for Google AI / Gemini
    GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

The application is structured into several key components to ensure modularity and readability.

* `components/`: Contains all reusable React components.
    * `PomodoroTimer.tsx`: The main Pomodoro timer interface modal.
    * `PomodoroProgress.tsx`: The slim progress bar displayed at the top.
    * `MusicPlayer.tsx`: The fixed music control bar at the bottom.
    * `FocusQuote.tsx`: The component that displays the AI-generated quotes.
    * `TerminalLoader.tsx`: The initial boot-up sequence animation.
* `app/page.tsx`: The main entry point and page for the application, where all components are assembled and state is managed.
* `ai/quote-flow.ts`: Contains the logic for interacting with the AI model to fetch focus quotes.
* `lib/utils.ts`: Utility functions, including the `cn` function from `shadcn/ui` for merging Tailwind CSS classes.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

* **Music Playback:** The application uses the `react-youtube` library to embed an invisible YouTube player. It plays audio from a predefined list of YouTube video IDs, effectively turning them into radio stations. State is managed with `useState` and `useRef` to control playback and volume.
* **Pomodoro Logic:** The timer is built using `useState` and `useEffect` hooks. A `setInterval` function decrements the `timeLeft` state when the timer is active. When time reaches zero, an alert is triggered, and the timer mode automatically switches (e.g., from 'work' to 'shortBreak').
* **AI Quote Generation:** When a 'work' session ends, the `handleTimerCompletion` function calls the `getFocusQuote` server action. This action securely calls the AI API on the backend, generates a unique quote, and returns it to the client to be displayed in an alert dialog.
